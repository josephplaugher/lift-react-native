# Lift React Native
## Cross-Platform mobile app version of the [web app](https://github.com/josephplaugher/lift)
A simple and effective app designed for people who strength train to track their workouts and monitor progress. I designed it with powerlifters and weightlifters in mind, but it can be used to track any kind of strength training. The front end/mobile app is built in react native with typescript. The backend is built in [nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) with typescript.<br/>
